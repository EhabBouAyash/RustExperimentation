# RustExperimentation
#first install rust: we use this script to install it (on macos in our scenario):

#curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

#After that just close the terminal and launch it again as rustc --version to check if it's properly installed. 

#To compile use "rustc <filename.rs>"
#then execute using ./<filename.rs>
